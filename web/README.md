### Conference Web Site

These scripts are for producing the conference papers site. They were
used for CCS 2017 to produce the
[https://acmccs.github.io](https://acmccs.github.io/) site. 

The scripts are very kludgely, and have lots of CCS 2017 information
hard coded in them. Nevertheless, we hope they are still useful to
future chairs in this form, and perhaps someone will put effort into
making them more easily adapted to future conferences.

If you have any problems using these, feel free to contact me (David
Evans, [evans@virginia.edu](mailto:evans@virginia.edu)) for help.
